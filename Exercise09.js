//Exercise 9
//Adding Comments:
//Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
//Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
//  Program #1
let myFavoriteNumber = 6; //This program defines a variable named myFavoriteNumber and assigns the numerical value 6 to it.
let message2 = `my favorite number is ${myFavoriteNumber}`; //This program reveals the stored favorite number using TypeScript template literals.
console.log(message2); // console.log for printing the message
//  Program #2
console.log(5 + 3); //This program outputs the result of the addition operation `5 + 3`, which is `8`, to the console.
console.log(5 + 3);
console.log(5 + 3);
console.log(5 + 3);
